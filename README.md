# Csharp-Assignment
My last C# assignment which involved the use of objected oriented programming and algorithms to sort data in various ways.

This assignment was broken up into 4 different segments.

  Maximum:
  This program finds the highest values in a randomly generated array, it is currently hardcoded to find the 3 highest values.

  Occurance:
  This program is made to find a given occurance of a value in an array of randomly generated integers. 
  It does so by getting using a modified sequential search algorithm to find the user input value and occurence, then outputs the index of the result.

  LastOccurance:
  This program is very similar to the previous one, except that its purpose is to find the last occurance of a given value in the randomly generated array.

  Bubble:
  This program showcases the difference in efficiency of two different bubble sort algorithms. 
  The first bubble sort is a regular bubble sort with no optimization, the second bubble sort is modified to be more efficient by making less comparisons.
